# Color-Flicker

That's the (I don't know, fourth?) color-flicker that i made in my life. I go back to basics now and than, to refresh my mind about things that i was supposed to know already. And surprisingly, I always get some things wrong at a first glance.

## Level AAA Conformance
This time I went with a different objective. I needed to create something that could complement my studies in accessibility. So, by now, it already have some number of colors (that will be increased soon!)
